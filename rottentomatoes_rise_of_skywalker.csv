By this time, the essence of ""Star Wars"" had been compromised, and it is quite clear that they acknowledged this. Supporting evidence is unnecessary, as their attempt to correct the course in this installment suggests the truth of the matter. Unfortunately, they once again sought to diminish the legacy of the Skywalker family, allowing the new protagonist, Rey, to claim all the accolades, even adopting the name of the family that had sacrificed so much for the galaxy.

Even if a significant portion of the film focuses on aspects that might be perceived as critical of George Lucas's initial six-episode saga, it is commendable that the filmmakers attempted to rectify certain elements. For instance, the movie provides Rey with a lineage, which is intriguing, as it contrasts with her established background in ""The Last Jedi,"" where she was portrayed as someone of no particular significance. This new narrative reveals her connection to Palpatine, a development that is quite interesting, especially for those who have followed the Skywalker saga, and it also offers a rationale for her considerable abilities. Furthermore, the film includes scenes of Rey Palpatine undergoing training, which serves to reassure the audience about the protagonist's eventual triumph. Moreover, the decision to bring back Han Solo to facilitate his son's return to the light side of the Force is a positive development, even though the manner of his return might not entirely align with established lore. While the lack of a clear explanation for this might be considered a shortcoming, the effort to honor Han Solo is appreciated. Finally, there is an attempt to redeem Luke Skywalker, though it is somewhat limited to a brief statement of regret and a display of his Force abilities, which, while reminiscent of Yoda's actions in ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" feels somewhat insufficient and comes rather late in the narrative.

Furthermore, the introduction of healing powers to Rey Palpatine and Kylo Ren seems to present another issue, especially considering that Anakin Skywalker's turn to the dark side was influenced by such abilities. It seems that this power should not have been included, as the core teaching emphasizes that possessive attachment can lead to negative actions. While this might be acceptable in video games due to their distinct logic, it raises questions within the context of the films. Wasn't it Palpatine himself who deemed such powers unnatural? This not only undermines Anakin's story but also removes any significant consequences from the plot, as healing simply requires rest, which is different from reviving someone. However, doesn't reviving someone seem like a power associated with the dark side? It simply doesn't quite align with the established narrative.

The return of Emperor Palpatine (Darth Sidious) in the film was a particularly disappointing aspect. It, once more, diminishes the sacrifice made by the Skywalker family in their effort to defeat him in ""Return of the Jedi."" While considering the entire family, the significance of Rey Palpatine's ultimate victory over him is that it undermines and excludes Anakin Skywalker's role as the Chosen One, as she is now presented as such. If Rey were destined to bring balance to the Force, as the Force operates, a different villain should have been employed to avoid altering the legacy of George Lucas's six-episode saga, allowing her to be the Chosen One and the heroine of her own narrative without compromising the established story.

Let us now consider some less significant issues. It is also apparent that it is not coincidental that the male characters, specifically Finn and Poe Dameron, and arguably Chewbacca, are seemingly inconsequential and expendable, as they lack substantial relevance. Furthermore, it is disappointing that the primary trio, consisting of Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron, who are intended to be the heroes, have experienced minimal character development. Observing these characters in the initial film, The Force Awakens, and then in the concluding film, The Rise of Skywalker, reveals that they have remained virtually unchanged. Rey Palpatine, for instance, has only gained more power, which, while a possible direction, is not the core issue. It is worth noting that she maintains the same personality and demeanor as in the first film.

It is truly disheartening that the characters possessed such potential, even if we set aside discussions of alternative possibilities. Rey Palpatine, Finn, and Poe Dameron were all quite intriguing, yet their potential remained largely unexplored. Nevertheless, that concludes my thoughts on this particular film."

Loved it! The Rise of Skywalker may be chaotic at times, but it’s also one of the most emotional and visually spectacular Star Wars films ever made. From the first frame, the movie moves at hyperspeed, filled with energy, nostalgia, and heart. It feels like a love letter to the entire saga packed with familiar faces, epic actions and a sweeping score that reminds us why we fell in love with Star Wars in the first place, Visually spectacular movie.

Rey’s journey is powerful and heartfelt, and Daisy Ridley gives her best performance yet. The chemistry between the trio Rey, Finn, and Poe finally shines, Atlast we saw all of them having a journey together and Ben Solo’s redemption adds real emotional weight. Visually, it’s a feast, the colors, planets, and ship battles are jaw-dropping, and John Williams’ music gives it a sense of finality.

The pacing feels a bit rushed, and the story tries to do too much at once, leaving some ideas underdeveloped. But despite its flaws, it delivers on pure entertainment, emotion, and spectacle. It’s a flawed but passionate conclusion and even with all its craziness, it still manages to make you feel like a kid watching Star Wars for the first time again."

 JJ Abrams builds on the previous two movies’ characters and themes to create a satisfying conclusion to not just them, but also the entire saga. Bringing Palpatine back was a good decision because, first, he’s one of the greatest cinematic villains, and, secondly, it ties together all three trilogies. By the way, the people who talk bad about the “Somehow Palpatine returned” line are doing so in bad faith—we as an audience can gather from the opening alone that there’s some sort of tech keeping his frail body alive, plus, one of the Resistance soldiers replies to Poe in the literal next line: “Dark science, cloning.

“Somehow, Palpatine returned.”

Personally, I liked episode 7’s twist with Luke cutting himself off from the force, but bringing back Palpatine just takes it too far.

The Rise of Skywalker (Episode IX) is the final nail in the coffin of a trilogy that never understood what made Star Wars meaningful in the first place.

Instead of a strong, coherent story, we got a movie that felt like it was written by committee rushed, chaotic, and desperate to please everyone and as a result, pleasing no one. The plot is bloated with meaningless twists, nostalgia bait, and character decisions that make no sense. Palpatine’s return was lazy fan service, Rey’s lineage was a retcon that undercut her earlier development, and characters like Finn and Poe were completely wasted.

Worse, this movie actively disrespects the legacy of the original trilogy. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Leia deserved better. Their arcs were either ignored, reversed, or used as emotional bait to prop up new characters who lacked depth and earned payoff.

Disney’s Star Wars isn’t Star Wars. It’s a hollow imitation that swaps mythic storytelling for flashy CGI, depth for spectacle, and emotional weight for corporate branding. If you love the soul and spirit of A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, you’ll likely walk away from this trilogy especially Episode IX feeling frustrated and betrayed."

Rey did not go through the trials and tribulations like Luke Skywalker did.  She just became a Jedi and mastered the force as if it just came to her. That is something I did not like.  Part 8 I laughed through.  It was so bad.  I told my niece and nephew I will not pay to go to another Star Wars movie.  I subscribed to Disney Plus and lo and behold, there was The Rise of Skywalker.  I debated watching this last installment, but I eventually relented and watched it.  I had watched the entire Star Wars Visions seasons one and two in one weekend which was good.  I wanted to see what they did with the Rise of Skywalker.  I have to say, it was pretty good.  Yes, it's not Lucas's vision.  If they wanted a strong female lead this whole time, they could have stuck with what Lucas had wanted to do.  Have Han and Leia's daughter become a Jedi and their son become just like his father.  Instead of trying to pander to an audience that would not watch this or buy their merchandise, they should have taken the original fans into consideration that made this valuable franchise a lot of money and made it very popular.  But alas, they did not and did not learn their lesson.  I think Abrams tried to turn everything around in this story.  I feel Abrams should have been the one overseeing all three of them and keeping the stories from slipping like it did in the 8th one.  God knows his Star Trek films were pretty good (I liked the two he directed-if you don't agree, we can agree to disagree).  I feel there should have been a foreshadowing that Rey was Palpatine's granddaughter and the fact that he killed her parents.  I find foreshadowing in stories has become a lost art.  Come on writers, you should know better!  Look up how to use that plot device!  It makes for better story telling.  Anyway, I am not going to give away anymore, but this movie is worth watching.  Rey should have had the same arc that Luke Sky walker had.  If they would have done that to begin with, she would have been a stronger character.  The same with Kylo Ren.  We should have had a character arc of how he became the person he was and why he was with the Empire rather than the rebels with his parents.  A few more drafts would have worked out better."

This movie offers nothing new and only serves to remind us how old things are better...however, not because they were old, but because they were indeed better made and delievered.  Dialogue is somehow worse than ever.  Characters serve no purpose.  And obvious jokes come at the expense of world building.  Literally nothing is new and the imagination in this movie is 0.  Its a frustrating affair only gets worse with each scene.

There are literally 1,000s of directions this franchise could have gone in this sequal triology.  And they choose by far the worse possible interation.  My only hope is that his triology is forgotten.  

At this point the only thing that can save star wars is a total reboot movie saga.  Just reboot everything.  Think it through and give us that.  But I doubt Disney has the ability to write this wrong and deliver anything meaningful.  Afterall, all they want is cash.  0/10, hell 0/1000 for this movie / triology.  Just fing awful."

Basically he had to make a trilogy in a single film, hence why there are so many plots that are started in ep9

There is a lack of cohesiveness flowing from episodes 7-9.  Since selling the franchise, one gets the impression that Lucas was not on each films set regularly to help provide guidance.    It’s my belief that The Last Jedi was the only original and daring film of the three, even though the cynical depiction of downer Luke was poorly received.  The Force Awakens was A New Hope remake but it had heart and great performances.   We all loved it in part because of the potential we saw afterwards, in the next two films. 
The Last Jedi was unpredictable and shocking, and it maybe went too far in that direction.  Killing Snoke was a bold move in the beautifully filmed red throne room fight scene, but it left the third film in a bad spot as to where to take the story.    In LOTR, Sauron had a number of henchmen that were scary  by themselves. If Snoke had someone that maybe competed with Kylo a bit in Force Awakens, maybe Snoke would have promoted that person above Kylo at the beginning of TLJ.  And Kylo and Rey would have killed that person in the red room scene.  Snoke should have remained the main villain through Episode 9 with his own cool origin story and motivations, and Palpatine never should have shown back up the way he did in Rise of Skywalker. 
So then by Rise of Skywalker the whole trilogy just feels clunky and scrambled. RoS was desperation manifested. I loved the Leia / Rey training scene and I loved how Luke lifted the X Wing out of the water in homage to ESB.  That’s all. The rest of the movie I can’t remember well. 
RoS is the only Star Wars movie I could only watch once.  Even Last Jedi I’ve seen at least 15 times.  Empire Strikes Back I’ve watched over a hundred times, easily. 
It’s too bad that the sequel trilogy ended up being a disappointment."

The beginning half is dumb and has to go really quickly about itself to scramble together a narrative, doing little with what the previous movie did or did not set up. With all that said however, I think a lot of good decisions were made and it's still clear that the makers love Star Wars. Maybe it's not such a bad thing, that watching the trilogy I almost feel like it was over before it began. There is still so much potential there and I'd love to see more of it. The new characters and puppetry is adorable and there are quite a few funny quips but that does not make of for the overall lack of coherence in the trilogy. I won't blame Abrams or Johnson for this as it was clearly mismanaged from the very start. With the Avengers as such a great rolemodel to follow they could have easily set up two trilogies with extra Star Wars Sagas adjacent to the main story but instead planned nada and fell on their face. It's a ridiculous mismanagement of a huge investment on Disney's side and a huge sorrow for all fans out their who were so willing to wish the best for the outcome. 

Another interesting observation about the story and how it relates to the US is the undeniable decline and the impending revolution for that country. Corporate greed is killing and undermining everything we hold dear and the movie could easily become a rallying cry in the revolution to come."

Luke Skywalker's personality change back to tatooine whiny child, the Canto Blight Finn/Rose, let's pay benicio del Toro for some weird reason offshoot journey, The horrendous fight choreography with purposefully edited shots of missed lightsaber swings and hits, mixed in with figure skating moves..... The inability of supreme leader snoke to see that his apprentice was going to kill him in front of his own eyes...... These are the true travesties to storytelling in the Star wars universe.  

This sequel makes sense and does not try to be something that the Star wars franchise is not, which is whatever episode 8 was.  This is not a franchise about taking risks. It is primarily about connecting the dots back to the old movies.  Especially after the tone was set with episode 7, that this wasn't going to be a new story featuring all new cast.   I find it extremely hard to believe that 91% of ""movie critics"" somehow found episode 8 acceptable, but only 41% of the audience did. It's very clear that the audience widely enjoyed the last episode more than episode 8.... Which is the true travesty to this franchise.  Let's see how many Canto blight Lego sets we can sell.  Let's see how many key maker figures we can get on the streets.  Give me a break episode 9 gives the viewers some relief and finality to what was an utterly lost and grossly awry interpretation of the Star wars franchise."

Look you could have brought Palpatine back if the rest of the movies were clearly leading up to it, the Force Awakens and TLJ (while both being dumpster fires in their own rights) had no indications that this was where the sequels were going to end. 

My biggest issue is, where does this movie leave the Star Wars universe, Rey is the only one left... and she has had no character development at all yet.

This is probably one of the most bafflingly rushed and revised loves that's too insecure of the fan backlash to its predecessors, so it just oversaturates the screen with so many retcons, new additions, and shallow fan-service moments that turn the movie into a blue-tinted sugar-rushed incoherent mess of a finale. So many insane story decisions (SPOILERS), like Palpatine's unexplained resurrection, Rey's heritage as a Palpatine, the implications that her father was a clone (or that Elderly deformed Palpatine had intercourse), Rey accidentally killing Chewie with force lightning from a tug-of-war with Kylo only to immediately reveal he's ok, General Hux being a spy to spite Kylo Ren, Poe being an asshole again who didn't learn his lesson from Last Jedi (really dragging down the once-charming chemistry of the main leads), Chewbacca finally getting his Battle of Yavin medal 35 years later, Snoke being cloned, etc. Even the opening title crawl, ""The Dead Speak!"" just put me in a laughing fit. But the sad kind where you're just confused at how bad the story quality dropped. The movie's saving grace is it's competent filmmaking techniques, decent acting, and solid pacing that keep it consistently entertaining despite its bad storyline. I also liked a few small moments, like Han Solo appearing in a vision to win back Ben Solo, Luke handing Rey back the lightsaber to cap off his TLJ arc, Leia's jedi backstory, Lando finally appearing, Babu Friik, the Kimji planet, etc. It's still up to debate for which is the worst Star Wars movie. The worldbuilding and story/character designs & choices aren't nearly as creative as The Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones. But it still has much better acting, filmmaking, dialogue, effects, and cultural sensitivity than either of those two. It's not an awful Star Wars movie, but it's easily one of the most disappointing, considering it's the finale to a 9-film saga that's touched the hearts of millions throughout the galaxy."

I did not particularly enjoy the acting; while the new trio was well-cast, they lacked the chemistry of the original one. However, my biggest issue was with the plot. As many have already pointed out, resurrecting the big bad guy from the original trilogy is one of the laziest plot devices ever conceived and implies that Anakin never was the chosen one. [SPOILER] This is immediately followed by the appearance of tens of thousands of Star Destroyers (according to the novelization), whose construction nobody seemed to be aware of, each equipped with a Death Star-type cannon. In the first movie, a single one of these weapons was enough to terrorize the entire galaxy. Assuming a Star Destroyer is manned by the same number of officers as in the original trilogy (around 30,000), Emperor Palpatine would have had to assemble an army of at least half a billion personnel without anyone noticing. Yet none of them are stationed on Exegol to defend their leader. Similarly, the rebels' allies somehow account for a cartoonishly large force, conveniently gathered in less than a day. Where were they when fighting the First Order was necessary? My impression is that the director wanted to link most of the plot to the original series while scaling up every threat.

The lack of creating something new and leaving the past in the past is created by nostalgic despair with a conflict of interests between directors who do not agree with the other's decision.

I attribute most of the things wrong with this film to be cause of the former so I'll give it some slack. What I can't forgive though is bringing Palpatine back and giving the most ridiculous explanation for it ever. They also wasted the opportunity to make Rey Obi-Wan's granddaughter instead of Palpatine. Wait... Palpatine had children? Why? When? Does any of that make sense? How could they have not realized the potential thematic complexity and poetry of having Obi-Wan and Anakin still fighting after all these years through their grandchildren? Would have been perfect but here we are. There's the fact that all John Boyega has to do in this movie is shout REYYY. That's legitimately all he gets to do in this awful mess. We don't even get to learn what Finn wanted to say to Rey almost like it was a plot point they cut out of the movie. Rey kissing Ben by the end also churned my stomach cause didn't he like uh... I don't know... murder his own father right in front of you? So by the end all the ships show up cause Lando somehow gathered all of them in an afternoon despite no one answering the call in the last movie and it's completely contrived and by this point who honestly cares. Palpatine was as well able to build up an entire armada of ships with no one in the galaxy finding out about it and warning the New Republic. Wouldn't he have had to associate with people who followed the law of said republic to secure funding and resources at least at some point? Guess not. Bunch of crap. Screw this movie. And Rey does NOT get to call herself Rey Skywalker cause nothing she did was earned. She's just powerful cause this movie has to have a plot. They also had Chewbacca ""die"" only for him to miraculously survive rendering the entire thing pointless, and they completely changed Hux from a psychopathic dictator to some weasely spy. So dumb. So all over the place. Don't watch this movie."

The sequel trilogy struggles at best, but this film takes the cake. It does things without purpose or planning, perhaps the only remaining dynamic villain left was General Hux who just ends up being “the spy” was writing a plot twist for the sake of a plot twist. The ending final battle puts the entire Star Wars franchise in jeopardy, because it puts everything following this film in timeline little by comparison.

A final battle with thousands of massive destroyers from a Sith planet has never been seen before. With every Star Wars film one has seen before this; you’d think to yourself that there’s not a single way for this massive Sith fleet to fail. However, being the final film in a trilogy you know somehow they’re going to have this fleet fail and the Sith lose, the predictability knows no bounds. Palpatine returning out of nowhere is even known to the actors to be a terrible idea, that in its final release the film even has unenthusiastic lines of, “somehow Palpatine returned”. Unless it is acknowledged that the sequels and especially this film never happened, there cannot be a credible villain in a sequel to this. What more can you do than thousands of Sith destroyers that just gets wrecked by a random resistance fleet? The Sith have no more credibility and neither does any Empire/Order-like entity."

The story is terrible, as it tries to get the movie out of certain awful boxes that Rian Johnson tried so hard to put in place. It also underscores that basically all of what came before didn’t matter. 

The entire struggle of the Rebellion to defeat the Empire? Well Palpatine actually had a much more powerful Empire 2.0 ready to go.

Leia helping to establish a New Republic and restore peace? She dies after it was destroyed in a single scene and barely ever mentioned again.

Luke rebuilding the Jedi? It's also destroyed in a single scene.

Luke's unwavering faith that the most evil mass murdering monster in the galaxy could be redeemed? He contemplates killing his own nephew over a bad feeling and becomes a miserable recluse.

Anakin sacrificing himself to kill Palpatine? Somehow Palpatine returned.

Han dead, Luke dead, Leia dead and everything they ever accomplished undone. All for what? None of it was in service of some grand vision."

The audience criticized The Last Jedi, so I assume they blew up any sense of a story they had going on this movie and tried to pepper in scenes to pander to fans of the old movies? They tried and failed miserably to create emotional scenes by repeating the same trick over and over. 

Spoilers to explain how bad it is:
-They kill of Chewbacca only to tell you he's still alive within the next 5 minutes 
-They ""kill off"" C-3PO by deleting his memory only to restore it later in the movie.
-They bring back Han Solo as a ghost
-They bring back Luke as a ghost
-They bring Emperor Palpetine back from the dead(he just never died apparently)
-Rey mortally wounds Kylo Ren, but regrets it and uses the force to re-alive him.
-Kylo is killed by the emperor by being violently thrown into a canyon.
-Rey re-kills the emperor, but she dies in the process
-Kylo Ren/Ben never died, climbs out of the canyon, revives Rey with the force and they make out, but that causes him to really die this time. 
-Leia died and came back as a force ghost. 

If you've watched all of the films up until this point, you are forced to watch this one. But it adds absolutely nothing to the story that was built over several decades and is in fact a cheap and lazy step backwards. All the old storylines that were wrapped up in prior movies, Palpetine's rise through politics to become the Emperor , Luke Skywalker's journey from local boy to Jedi Master, Han Solo's lack of character arc, were reopened non-sensically for this movie."

The mistake they made was making three of these movies without a story in place. The only trilogy I will abandon and never admit to its existence. It makes me sad that Disney is tripling down to try and salvage anything they can from this mess. 
I recommend skipping this movie entirely and watching the Clone Wars Series or Empire Strikes Back. At least you will not waste your time."

Yes, the movie does not bore you, it is action packed and moves at a relatively fast narrative speed, but there are absolutely nothing that makes the previous films special left in this film, it is terribly hallow. Characters that have enormous potentials like Finn and Poe does not get any attention in the film, and the main character Rey which trilogy spends two movie portraying got to be one of the most disappointing main character in any Star Wars Media, Daisy Ridley is a good actress and did the best she could with what she was given, but that does not change the fact that what she was given was a Mary Sue character who barley have any character development in any of the movies. Now to the antagonist, bringing Palpatine back shows that the producer does not want to spend any time on portraying a new character, but the reveal is not only poorly written(since the film never explained how he returned), bring Palpatine back basically means all the work that the characters did in the previous six films are worth nothing, cause according to the movie:""Somehow, Palpatine returned"". The ending of this movie is also terribly written, until now, 5 years later, I still does not understand why Rey was able to defeat Palpatine just because she got another lightsaber. Oh did I forgot to mention, there are no ending fight scenes in this movie, just a mary sue character reflecting lighting. Overall, if episode 8 is a movie that divided the franchise, episode 9 united the franchise once again, because of how disappointing it is."

Abrams back on directing duties since The Force Awakens as the story of new characters Rey, Finn, Poe and Kylo Ren draws to a close in typically epic fashion.

With the mixed reaction second chapter The Last Jedi prompted back in 2017, there seemed to be a conscious effort by Disney to regroup somewhat, especially after the disappointing reception of Solo: A Star Wars Story the following year. The Rise Of Skywalker had to be either universally beloved or, at the very least, satisfying as an ending to most Star Wars fans to make this regrouping worthwhile. From its opening text crawl, this sequel already appears to make a conscious jump past The Last Jedi and back onto more familiar territory with the reintroduction of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and Rey's plot focusing even more on her origins.

""The dead speak!"", we are told, moments before Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) travels solo to The Emperor's lair, an old-school mad scientist lab complete with half-finished Supreme Leader Snoke clones in water tanks (lol), screaming lightning (I'm not kidding) and big magnifying glasses everywhere (still not kidding). Palpatine is every bit as over-the-top as you'd expect and the overall tone here is reminiscent of old horror B-movies, which certainly could have been apt seeing as the likes of horror giants Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were once a big part of this franchise. Unfortunately, the Palpatine scenes are where all this begins and ends, and all that remains is the nagging feeling that these tonal shifts and this apparently random reviving of Emperor Palpatine might not actually work.

""Somehow the Emperor's back!"", Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) exclaims at one point in the movie, with the word ""somehow"" doing a heck of a lot of heavy lifting here. And this is a good way to understand what's... off about this movie: somehow most of The Last Jedi isn't so important now, somehow Rose isn't a main character anymore, somehow Lando Calrissian's back and he has the entire world on speed-dial, somehow Force healing is a big thing all of a sudden, somehow The Emperor is ALL the Siths, somehow Rey has mastered every power by running in the woods, and so on.

Not that the film never explains anything but there is a lot it, indeed, doesn't explain and, in fact, the overall pacing of this installment feels extremely rushed and J.J. Abrams' erratic, perhaps more Star Trek-friendly, direction is mostly to blame for this. 

Fortunately, after a frankly clunky first act, we are given a solid second act that's genuinely entertaining and should keep the attention of even the grumpiest Star Wars fan. Rey wrestles with the good and the bad within her as Kylo Ren closes in, C3P0 (Anthony Daniels doing great work, as usual) becomes key to the Resistance's success, Poe reveals his darker past and there are some fun action sequences along the way. Fair homage is paid to the late Carrie Fisher and there are some enjoyable enough, if gimmicky cameos here and there. Sadly, brand new characters like Richard E. Grant's Allegiant General Pryde and Naomi Ackie's Jannah aren't given much to work with and the likes of Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Maz (Lupita Nyong'o) are criminally cast aside, as if there was never any plan for them.

The softening of The Last Jedi's bolder ideas hurts this movie which, too often, feels like a cowardly retreat into safer territory, actual drama be damned. There are elements explored here that do work, admittedly: the closing of Kylo Ren's character arc is mostly effective and it's rewarding to see Ben Solo being himself, even for a brief moment, while Poe and Finn collaborating as the new leaders of the Resistance makes sense. There are also some good ideas in there like Rey potentially killing Chewbacca by mistake or C3P0 tragically losing his memory to save his friends' lives but the film refuses to actually go there and undoes all this within minutes, perhaps for fear of offending a single die-hard fan who might tweet negatively about all of this or for fear of instilling real emotions into the movie.

Truthfully, this feels like a film based on an older script that was reworked much later on with lots of unclear ideas thrown in and shadows of better prior ideas still visible, but only just. The writing as a whole, by the way, is rather weak especially when it comes to the dialog, but we've seen this many times before in the Star Wars franchise so it's almost to be expected at this point. Though it's never all that welcome.

This is a fast-paced movie that does everything you'd expect in a Star Wars film, Ewoks even pop up briefly, but it doesn't so much feel like the end of an epic trilogy as it does the final breath of a rebooted franchise that was not carefully worked-out from the beginning and can't wait to end once and for all. Some of it is fan-service, some of it is almost stream of consciousness, none of it feels quite right but, at the very least, it's never dull.

And not even the fanservice is well done, since only the voices of the ancient Jedi appear but not in ghosts, that Palpatine goes from starring in one of the best Star Wars deaths in episode 6 to the most pathetic and meaningless of the Saga , or that it was the ghost of Han Solo that convinced Kylo to turn to the light side, when it would be more logical for it to be Anakin...

Do you love Star Wars? If you do, do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie, it will ruin your perception of the franchise. Episode 6 was the perfect ending to the Skywalker saga, Anakin bringing true balance to the force in the perfect conclusion so there's no need to watch episodes 7, 8 and 9 and watch beloved characters drastically change their personalities off screen. Mark Hamill stated it best when he said that he felt he wasn't playing Luke he had to pretend it was a different character that he named Jake Skywalker. There's nothing that brings me more anger and rage than this movie, just thinking about it boils my blood, but if you like hearing a character yell REY repeatedly, ""they fly now…yeah they fly now"", seeing major liberties taken with the force to make you feel like you're in Hogwarts, and space horses then this movie is for  you."

The main issue that kills this is the terrible pacing. This movie never commits to ideas and is more concerned with throwing more and more nonsensical, incoherent, going against canon nonsense at you at a rapid rate. While the fast pacing worked for Force Awakens, it does the exact opposite here. From Rey being a Palpatine, Luke knowing she was a Palpatine and trained her anyway, Lando getting the whole galaxy together in a few hours, horses, Rey kissing Kylo, Saving Kylo, Giving Kylo a lightsaber telepathically, Finn never telling Rey what he wanted to say, The Wayfinder matching the destroyed Death Star II ruins in a very specfic spot, Millions of Sith, Chewies Fakeout, The Emperor just being back out of nowhere, none of it makes any sense. And as stylish, slick, nostalgic, and well produced production wise this is, it starts to slowly collapse under its own weight of incoherent ideas to the point this movie somehow becomes boring by the second half with no suspense. The editing isn't good either. While we say focused on the same group of characters after the first 20 minutes it follows them with just an illogical flow of ideas and telling of events that doesn't flow at all. The music is about the best thing. It's good but not up to par with the rest of the franchise mainly because of the inconsistent tone and inconsistent scenes. The cinematography is not good despite having all the production value. The CGI is decent but used in over the top, oversaturated ways especailly at the end, and the production value is used for nonsensical scenes. The acting is just ok. These are good performances but there weighed down by decisons and motivations that make no sense a lot of times and every so often espeically Poe they have to give long plot exposes to explain this mess as best they can. The Emperor should'nt have been here and feels so out of place. This never commits to ideas, ignores canon, and ignores things like Rose which was set up from the last film as being pivital. Skip this even though its the last one. It's a mess."

This Star Wars movie had everything and was as entertaining as return of the Jedi. It's a shame as the more questions you ask the more confusing and annoying it becomes  as things don't really make a whole lot of sense. That could be due to the last Jedi messing things up. This easily could of been two movies by just how rushed it all felt. I like Rey but I don't believe she should of been a palpatine, but I certainly liked the idea of them flipping it and her turning to the dark side (oh well)  The emperor was at his most menacing in this movie then ever seen before, even if bringing him back undone Luke and Anakin's story a little. This film is best when you switch off and enjoy the nostalgia and the epic moments it does have to offer. Visually the best Star Wars and also some brilliant acting. There's things we'd of all liked to see but this is what we got and it still doesn't touch the OT but it is easily the most entertaining of the 3 

Kylo Ren (Ben solo) cemented himself among my favourite Star Wars characters who easily had the best character arc."

Stuff happens that only makes sense. The viewer would need a pause button to sit there & fill in all the blanks, but there's no time because of the smash cut editing and pointless action. I feel awful for Finn's character (who is clearly sidelined here). Poe is downgraded to a silly sidekick as well. I'm not one of those fans who thinks they can write a better movie. I absolutely can't. But hey that's not my job. Disney has endless funding/resources and it was THEIR duty to end this 40 year saga with some integrity. And it's disheartening for the regular people (like myself) who love Star Wars to watch as this movie disregards the tremendous possibilities that the Skywalker saga presented. Wow, this film could've had some emotional heft to it. Abrams could've gut punched us with an emotionally explosive conclusion, but instead, it feels like Kathleen Kennedy was breathing down his neck, the whole time to NOT make the last Jedi, and bring the whole thing in under two hours and 30 minutes. There are LOTS of movies with a 3-hour run time, and this one could've easily used another 30 minutes of character development, smoother editing, and an epically emotional final act. If you think I'm wrong, sit down and watch Andor. That has  a perfect mixture of powerful acting, character development, special effects, and star wars vibes ."

Palpatine’s return made no sense and undercut the entire original trilogy, and the final battle was pure chaos.

That isn't how lightsabers work at all. They even have the gaul to bot these reviews with the same ""loved Rey and Kylo"" and ""great ending to the franchise"" comments to boost the score. This film was a narrative nightmare with no direction that threw away the plot of the previous films leading to a disjointed mess that just gives the main characters what they need to rush though the story as fast as possible.

How did they know what the Death Star debris would look like before it was even destroyed???); and arguably worst of all, introduced both an army of baddies that couldn't have possibly existed AND an army of good-guy helpers who took 10 minutes to assemble and have been suspiciously absent up until this point in the entire saga, just because they needed a big battle.

Acting, is ok it could have been a lot better. CGI, is perfect no doubt about it. Villain, this is another reason why I liked the movie because it brought back Sidious and what's really interesting is why did the villains still exist even when Palpatine died in the explosion in Epi VI and this movie answers that question. Writing, I think that the writing was ok-good it could have been better. Story/Plot, it was ok and interesting. Casting is good-great. Characters, I think that the characters are great mostly because of the voices in Ray's head. Adventure, I think that the adventure was good like most Star Wars projects because we good threw and explore the galaxy and in this episode we traveled to the land of the Sith. Mystery, mystery is good because I always wondered what happens next especially in a movie like this bringing back the best of villains. Ending, in my opinion the ending was good but it does bring me to think No. 1 did Palpatine take over Ray's body? No. 2 did Palpatine die? And if my first theory is true than why isn't there an other Star Wars movie called ""Episode X"" to continue from Episode IX"

Kathleen Kennedy should be fired. If The Last Jedi was an insult to Star Wars fans, the ""Rise of Skywalker"" is like being shot in the head.

This movie offers nothing of value to the Star Wars universe, is full of plot holes and bad writing, and actually UNDOES the entire finale of Ep.6 by magically bringing back Sidious as villan. 

It was later revealed that Disney had no plan while making the sequel trilogy for any of the questions posed during the Force Awakens and that is not only disgraceful to Star Wars and it's fans but unforgiveable.

While it was a visually stunning and action-packed film, it struggled to balance its many plot threads and deliver a satisfying conclusion.

One of the strengths of the film was its cast, with Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and John Boyega all delivering strong performances. The chemistry between the actors was also evident, providing an emotional anchor for the film. Additionally, the film's special effects and cinematography were top-notch, providing breathtaking visuals and exciting action sequences.

However, the film's plot felt overstuffed and rushed. There were multiple storylines and character arcs to follow, and the film struggled to give each one the attention it deserved. As a result, many plot points felt rushed or underdeveloped, and it was difficult to fully invest in the film's story.

The Rise of Skywalker also relied heavily on nostalgia and fan service, often at the expense of character development and plot logic. While some moments may have been enjoyable for longtime fans, they did little to advance the story or provide a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.

In terms of direction, J.J. Abrams returned to helm the film after directing The Force Awakens, and while he was able to recapture the excitement of the franchise, the film suffered from a lack of cohesion and a clear vision. It felt like Abrams was trying to please everyone, resulting in a film that tried to do too much and ultimately fell short.

The film's score, composed by John Williams, was a highlight, as expected. The iconic Star Wars themes and motifs were used effectively, adding to the emotional weight of the film's key moments.

Overall, Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker was a flawed but enjoyable film. While it may not have been the satisfying conclusion that fans were hoping for, it was still an exciting and visually stunning adventure in the Star Wars universe."

TLJ was controversial but at least told a story and got creative. JJ Abrams took a hammer to it.

I just watched it 10 minutes ago and I couldn't even tell you what it's about (except for destroying the Empire [excuse me, ""The Final Order"", because apparently he even had to rename it again to make sure TLJ had no impact on the canon]), again, and some big battle scene that made no sense at the end and was full of bad writing. Even the characters seemed to have trouble getting on board with half the things in Abrams' contribution to the story.

The only thing that saved it is the Star Wars universe and continuity canon and story. That alone made it entertaining and a movie a Star Wars fan should obviously watch. But, as many diehard fans have, prepare to be outraged with the complete lack of respect to the SW universe and ROTS' predecessor, The Last Jedi, while simultaneously being hands down the worst title out of the 9 movies.

If you're going to take a hatchet to the last director's work because you don't like what they added to the canon and universe, at least be ready to do better. ROTS doesn't even get off the starting blocks."

Palpatine was really boring in this movie, which I would never say about his performance in the other movies. The ending, where Poe says ""There's too many of them"" and Lando saying ""But there are more of us"" was just TRYING TO AVENGERS ENDGAME SO HARD. But this movie is nowhere near as good as Endgame. Hell, in my opinion, it's not even nearly as good as the other Star Wars movies (yes, that includes the prequels and the Last Jedi). This movie just killed my interest in the franchise that I hold very close to my heart.

I wonder what JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson's relationship is like, because according to these films, they absolutely despise each other. From the line, ""A Jedi's weapon deserves more respect"" to the minimization of Rose, to the following interaction, ""We need to pull some Holdo maneuvers""... ""Come on. That move is one in a million"", Abrams is purposefully jabbing at The Last Jedi the whole film.

Take away those feelings of division, and this film is still not very good. It was nice to see the three heroes on a journey together (though that probably should have happened in Episode VII). There are some truly stunning visual sequences (though not as good as Episode VIII).

Unfortunately, since the stakes keep getting raised every film (Death Star, bigger Death Star, fleet of Death Stars, etc.) my investment level is very low. When Finn says, ""We take the war to them!"", I stopped and wondered ""who exactly is ""them""?

A disappointing end to a retcon mess of a trilogy, it's frustrating to think about the potential of what could have been.

Best Scene: Passing the lightsaber from Rey to Kylo (though I don't love the implications with force manipulation, the scene is pretty cool)

Having said that, The Rise of Skywalker is a very, very, very dumb film, overblown in every conceivable way, and chock-full of contrivances that come from absolutely nowhere to allow the plot to progress (at a clip that was likely set solely so nobody in the audience can stop and think about how stupid it all is).  However, considering that EVERY plot thread from The Force Awakens was severed and made irrelevant in The Last Jedi, it's clear that the writers were forced to come up with something to completely rewrite this now completely broken trilogy.  I will also give the movie that it actually does have some good action sequences - something that was, somehow, almost entirely missing from its two predecessors, and both the cinematography and Art Design are better than in the previous entry as well.  The music is solid and the VFX (which I actually helped with -- not as an artist but as someone who actually helped fix a problem with a render farm!  No, seriously!!) are generally very solid as well.  The acting is kinda flat, but at this point it was clear that the morale of those involved with this trilogy had plummeted, so I don't discredit the Actors or the Director.  And in terms of things that this movie genuinely does right, it does allow the three main characters to be together for much of the movie (which is good as they have a unified charisma when together), the movie doesn't have the morally repugnant lessons that its predecessor had, and while I hated the finale from a story perspective, I do appreciate what it actually tried to do; like, serious points for trying.  They also had a moment I genuinely loved where Chewbacca breaks down and cries when Leia dies (her actress passed away before filming, so this isn't a spoiler), as characters grieving the losses of those that they, and the audience, loved was something also sorely missing from this film's predecessor.  The biggest flaw, really, beyond the almost insultingly contrived plot, is that the reintroduction of Palpatine as the main villain only acts to negate (almost entirely) the struggles of the main heroes in the original Trilogy.  It's odd, as simply having this be a different villain would've made this a lot better.  Overall, The Rise of Skywalker has fireworks, has energy, has charisma and has brain-damage - it tries and utterly fails, but I actually felt like the film wanted me to be happy, and so, truthfully, I cannot bring myself to hate it, despite how bad it ultimately is."

Don't get me wrong, as always a star wars film is a visual spectacle. In that regard alone this film succeeded. In all other ways, including the atrocious PR from disney before and after the films release, treating disgruntled long-term fans and critics like perpetrators of hate crimes, the movie failed utterly. Every plot twist and reveal seemed horribly contrived. Every attempt at humor was forced. Even the action scenes came across as though the showrunners treated it like some kind of obligation somehow. In the end though, don't know what I find more worthy of contempt. This film's bizarre, lackluster script or the fans of the film with their heads in the sand.

Absolute garbage that completely retcons the prophecy of the chosen one. If anakin didn't actually kill palpatine… then his entire character arc over six movies is pointless and irrelevant. JJ and Kennedy should be absolutely ashamed of themselves."
"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/yRGoAbDQ","","","Aug 15, 2022","The worst thing Star Wars has ever created. A movie that feels like it has no relation to all the movies before it, which detracts from, maybe even destroys, Anakin, Luke, and so many other character's arcs, and which decides to forget Finn, Poe, Rose and every other character the previous movies introduced in order to focus solely on Rey and maybe a bit of Kylo Ren. Overall this movie just feels like it is a massive joke on all the other star wars movies up to this point and is not at all deserving of being the finale, nonetheless canon in Star Wars."

I really didnt enjoy last jedi, I only watched it once and I wanted to just get up and leave but this one had me on the eage of my seat - in the good way! This one is a match to the first one and the characters feels true to the ones we are introduced to in the first one and the story makes more sense and feels like we are back in the world of star wars. If you like the first one you will definitely like this one but if you liked the last jedi then you might not like this one as mucht as this is a returen to the world introduced in the first one"

Not good at all. The plot was nonsensical. Your basic McGuffin chase against a villain who once again has the capability to destroy planets. But the McGuffin itself didn't make a lot of sense. And the villain's ability to destroy planets was a vain attempt to up the ante for a series in which the villains have already been capable of doing that... three times already. 

The appearance of the main antagonist basically steals the thunder from the original trilogy in this series. And his plans were seemingly patched together to keep the plot moving forward. 

This latest trilogy was bad as a whole, but this last installment was the worst and easily skipable."

"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/yePeXwBb","","","Aug 8, 2022","Upon my original 8/10 review - Just did a tripple bill topped with a midnight screening. Blimey! Anyway, I hated The Last Jedi at what I promised would be my LAST midnight screening, and although movies this late are spoiled by the timing of these midnight screening things, this one managed to keep me stoked. Actually finishes the whole saga off very nicely. The handling of the Carrie Fisher difficulty was quite good, considering they just wrote new dialogue around scenes cut from the first film in this trilogy, rather than CGI ing her in. A little forced, but for the most part worked. It's probably something of an 8/10, maybe more. They introduced a rather spectacular dark side aspect that I wish they gave a little more time to breath. Another positive that came out of this one is that it ties on to The Last Jedi quite well. I felt the Last Jedi ended up messing things set up in the first one, in the hands of another writer, but feel differently about that middle chapter now.

A later viewing, one that significantly down graded it

Having re-watched the originals, the prequels, rolled through the new seasons, the new movies, I reached this again to find it lacking something significant. I realise Carrie Fisher's death doubtless threw this movie out of orbit, however I think they would have done well to have recovered something of what was originally intended by CGI ing her in, while also adding the cut material from the Force Awakens, and writing around it. Her inclusion being limited to that, and the writing to shoe horn her in really undermined it all, seems horribly forced. Secondly, SPOILER, they shouldn't have killed Ben off at the end. They ended his life with a kiss between him and Rey, and, well, I'm just going to fan edit his disappearance out of it, so it seems as though they may have become something more afterwards - something of a troubled love story.

There's a lot of ideology thrown in here too, which sadly kept taking me out of the movie.  Shall never escape it, it seems."

It was just filled with random and questionable points. For example, on the planet Pasaana, Rey and everyone were being chased until they crashed into sinking sand. After sinking and falling into an underground tunnel system, it happened to be the exact place that had the exact thing they were looking for (the next clue which was a Sith dagger). Questionable choice to bring back Palpatine, though it didn't bother me cause it was important to the story. Plus he's just dope. Very random that there were so many ships with Palpatine on Exegol. There were still lots of things I enjoyed like the scenes with the force connecting Rey and Kylo between different planets. Luke was much more likable in this movie. The scenes at the Death Star ruins were awesome. Acting was great. CGI was great. Final fight scene with Rey, Kylo, and Palpatine was awesome as well as the rest of the fighting that happened on Exegol."
"","","","Aug 3, 2022","I was very surprised how much I liked this movie. It had some flaws and some unbelievable things happen in it for sure. It makes up for The Last Jedi though and Abrams cleverly connects the dots from what I disliked from the last movie that this move makes up for it. This movie had some great lightsaber battles and very good emotionally acted scenes. Overall was a fulfilling move with the nostalgia and I like what Abrams did with the ending. This movie helped redeem the last movie."

So many scenes felt like they were rushed, and I believe it's because Rian Johnson decided he wanted to tell his own story rather than continue what was started in The Force Awakens. I give the movie a 2 star rating due to having to finish up after the steaming pile of crap that was The Last Jedi, it really deserves more like a 1.5 at best."
